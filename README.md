Use F12 to enable or disable the script.

Make sure you have one folder and your implant in your inventory. If you want to keep any items in your inventoy, keep them in said folder. Also make sure there are no folders in your food supply. The script will use the 3rd slot in your inventory and the first slot in your food supply. 

This script will turn your character and check for inventories by pressing f. If it finds an inventory, it will determine if it is a dino or a food supply. If a food supply is found, it will transfer all to the food supply to restack food and then take 5 stacks from it. If a dino is found, it will transfer 5 stacks to the dino. 

Use this script along side the AutoFoodWater script to raise babies overnight. Just make sure that you are not hot or cold.
